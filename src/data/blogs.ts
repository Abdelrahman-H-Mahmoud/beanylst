## The Science of Coffee Storage

Proper coffee storage is crucial for maintaining flavor and freshness. Here's what you need to know:

### Key Factors Affecting Coffee Freshness

1. **Temperature**
   - Store at room temperature
   - Avoid refrigeration
   - Keep away from heat sources

2. **Light Exposure**
   - Store in opaque containers
   - Avoid clear glass jars
   - Keep away from direct sunlight

3. **Air Contact**
   - Use airtight containers
   - Consider one-way valve bags
   - Avoid paper bags for long-term storage

### Best Practices

| Storage Method | Pros | Cons |
|----------------|------|------|
| Airtight container | Excellent seal, reusable | Initial cost |
| Valve bag | Releases CO2, blocks oxygen | Single-use |
| Mason jar | Readily available | Light exposure |

*Remember: Buy fresh beans in small quantities and use within 30 days of roasting.*
